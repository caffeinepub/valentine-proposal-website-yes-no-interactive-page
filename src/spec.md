# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Valentine single-page experience with an optional Spicy (18+) mode, added spicy jokes and adult-themed “free passes,” a more reactive/harder-to-click “No” path, and an explicit “I love you” line at the end.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a clearly labeled “Spicy (18+) mode” toggle that is OFF by default, and gate all dirty/spicy jokes and adult-themed passes behind it.
- Add an optional UI surface to reveal a random dirty/spicy joke (only visible/usable when Spicy mode is enabled).
- Enhance the “No” path with escalating reactions/messages based on repeated No attempts, including an explicit “No is not an option” line, while keeping the flow usable and resettable.
- Make the “No” button playfully evasive/harder to click on the main question screen, escalating with attempts but staying on-screen and still eventually clickable.
- Add a visible “I love you” line in the post-Yes success/ending content.
- Add a coupon-style “Free Passes” section on the post-Yes success screen with at least “Kiss Pass,” “Feet Pass,” and a “Whatever you say” card, plus an explicit “Dick Pass” shown only when Spicy mode is enabled.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can opt into Spicy (18+) mode to see spicy jokes and adult-themed passes, experience a more animated/evasive “No” interaction that escalates with repeated attempts, and after choosing Yes they see an “I love you” ending plus a “Free Passes” coupon section.
